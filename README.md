# Top Movies APP

## Project Overview:

This was an App done with to enable a user to navigate through a Movies App while only using the Arrow keys left/right and up/down.  Up/Down enables a user to scroll between movie shelves while the left/right keys scroll through individual movies on a specific genre shelf.

### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

## Wins:
* This project was quite the learning experience coming from JavaScript to learn this new Java language.  I used CodeAcademy as my main resource in learning.  I also used a Turing classmate as a resource in learning Java since he had done a recent project in Java.  It was enjoyable to use Java's class based lanaguage and continue to build on OOP principles that I have used with JavaScript.

* As a user, you are able to add buddies, delete buddies, change an update, delete an update, view your buddies, and view your updates.

## Future Iterations:
* Continuing to add to user experience
